#Mean:

###Description:
	The "mean" is the "average" you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. 

###Formula:

	The Mean:
	
         x = ∑x/N
         
Here, ∑ represents the summation X represents scores N represents number of scores.

###Example:

 	3, −7, 5, 13, −2
 	
	The sum of these numbers is 3 − 7 + 5 + 13 − 2 = 12
	There are 5 numbers.
	The mean is equal to 12 ÷ 5 = 2.4
The mean of the above numbers is 2.4

Here is how to do it one line:
Mean = 3 − 7 + 5 + 13 − 25 = 125 = 2.4

#Median:

###Description:
	Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the 
	numbers must first be sorted, or arranged, in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. The median 
	can be used to determine an approximate average, or mean, but is not to be confused with the actual mean.

###Formula:

If the total number of numbers(n) is an odd number, then the formula is given below:

Median=(n+12)th term

If the total number of the numbers(n) is an even number, then the formula is given below:

Median=(n2)th term+(n2+1)th term2



###Example:

For odd number list:

3, 13, 7, 5, 21, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29

 
When we put those numbers in order we have:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56

 
There are fifteen numbers. Our middle is the eighth number:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56

 
The median value of this set of numbers is 23.

For even number list:

3, 13, 7, 5, 21, 23, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29

 
When we put those numbers in order we have:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 40, 56

 
There are now fourteen numbers and so we don't have just one middle number, we have a pair of middle numbers:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 40, 56

 
In this example the middle numbers are 21 and 23.

To find the value halfway between them, add them together and divide by 2:
21 + 23 = 44 then 44 ÷ 2 = 22

So the Median in this example is 22.
#Mode:

###Description:

The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often.[1] If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x (i.e, X = x) at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.

###Formula:

The mode is the most frequently occurring score or value.

###Example:
3, 7, 5, 13, 20, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29

In order these numbers are:
3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56

This makes it easy to see which numbers appear most often.

In this case the mode is 23.
